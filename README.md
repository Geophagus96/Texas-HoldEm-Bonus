The evaluator of cards is credited to [Kenneth](https://github.com/kennethshackleton/SKPokerEval), where the larger the evaluator number is ,the better the deck of cards is.

Before running any evaluating functions for the three different rules of the game, please download all header files and keep them with the evaluating files in the same file folder.

## Standard Game Rules
The header file containing the functions for evaluating the expectations for different initial situations for the standard game rule is included in [Evaluate_ante.h](https://github.com/Geophagus96/Texas-HoldEm-Bonus/blob/master/Evaluator_ante.h). To access the evaluating results, please run file [Eval_test_ante_Peng.cpp](https://github.com/Geophagus96/Texas-HoldEm-Bonus/blob/master/Eval_test_ante_Peng.cpp).

## Unstandard Game Rules One
The header file containing the functions for evaluating the expectations for different initial situations for unstandard game rule no.1 is included in [q2_Evaluator_ante.h](https://github.com/Geophagus96/Texas-HoldEm-Bonus/blob/master/q2_Evaluator_ante.h). To access the evaluating results, please run file [q2_Eval_test_ante_Peng.cpp](https://github.com/Geophagus96/Texas-HoldEm-Bonus/blob/master/q2_Eval_test_ante_Peng.cpp).

## Unstandard Game Rule Two 
The header file containing the functions for evaluating the expectations for different initial situations for unstandard game rule no.2 is included in [q3_Evaluator_ante.h](https://github.com/Geophagus96/Texas-HoldEm-Bonus/blob/master/q3_Evaluator_ante.h). To access the evaluating results, please run file [q3_Eval_test_ante_Peng.cpp](https://github.com/Geophagus96/Texas-HoldEm-Bonus/blob/master/q3_Eval_test_ante_Peng.cpp).

## Report and Proof
The [final report](https://github.com/Geophagus96/Texas-HoldEm-Bonus/blob/master/Report_YuzeZhou_YajieDuan_PengZhang.pdf) and the [proof](https://github.com/Geophagus96/Texas-HoldEm-Bonus/blob/master/Texas_Holdem_Bonus.pdf) for optimality of strategies are also included in the folder.
